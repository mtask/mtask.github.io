Cybersecurity specialist from Finland.

## What is this blog about?

I'll post about different subjects that I find interesting, and usually, this means topics that are more or less cybersecurity-related. 
I have a sysadmin background, and I try to maintain my ability to administrate modern systems and networks while not doing that professionally so much anymore, so my posts will most likely reflect this as well.
